# Activity: Filter with AND, OR, and NOT

## Introduction

In this lab, you’ll use the AND, OR, and NOT operators in SQL to filter for information. You’ll use SQL to get specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they’re in. You’ll be using the MariaDB shell to run SQL queries. **Disclaimer:** For optimal performance and compatibility, it is recommended to use either **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox** browsers while accessing the labs.

## What you’ll do

You have multiple tasks in this lab:

- Filter for login attempts that occurred after hours
    
- Filter for login attempts on specific dates
    
- Filter for login attempts from specific locations
    
- Filter for information on employees in specific departments
    
- Filter for information on employees not in a specific department
