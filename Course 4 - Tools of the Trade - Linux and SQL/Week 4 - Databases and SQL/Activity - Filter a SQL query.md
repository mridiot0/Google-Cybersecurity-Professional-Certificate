# Activity: Filter a SQL query

## Introduction

In this lab, you’ll apply basic filters to SQL queries to retrieve information from a database. You’ll use SQL to get specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they’re in. You’ll be using the MariaDB shell to run SQL queries. **Disclaimer:** For optimal performance and compatibility, it is recommended to use either **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox** browsers while accessing the labs.

## What you’ll do

You have multiple tasks in this lab:

- Return information on machines and their operating systems
    
- Filter for machines with a specific operating system
    
- Filter for employees in specific departments
    
- Filter for employees who use specific machines
