# Activity: Complete a join

## Introduction

In this lab, you’ll use INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN in SQL to retrieve information from two different tables. You’ll use these different types of SQL joins to join data from separate machines, employees, and login attempts tables. You’ll be using the MariaDB shell to run SQL queries. **Disclaimer:** For optimal performance and compatibility, it is recommended to use either **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox** browsers while accessing the labs.

## What you’ll do

You have multiple tasks in this lab:

- Use an inner join to find information on employees and their machines
    
- Use a left join and right join to find information on employees and their machines
    
- Use an inner join to find information on employees and their login attempts
