# Activity: Decrypt an encrypted message

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll complete a series of tasks to obtain instructions for decrypting an encrypted file. Encryption of data in use, at rest, and in transit is critical to security functions. You'll use the Linux skills you have learned to uncover the clues needed to decode a classical cipher, restore a file, and reveal a hidden message. **Disclaimer:** For optimal performance and compatibility, it is recommended to use either **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox** browsers while accessing the labs.

## What you’ll do

You have multiple tasks in this lab:

- List the contents of a directory
    
- Read the contents of files
    
- Use Linux commands to revert a classical cipher back to plaintext
    
- Decrypt an encrypted file and restore the file to its original state
    

## Lab instructions

### **Start the lab**

Before you start, you can review the [Resources for completing labs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assets-threats-and-vulnerabilities/supplement/HTg94/resources-for-completing-labs). Then from this page, click **Launch App**. A Qwiklabs page will open and from that page, click **Start Lab** to begin the activity!

_You may attempt this lab a maximum of 5 times, and you will have 60 minutes to complete this lab during each attempt._

### **End the lab**

From within the lab, click **End Lab** to end your lab.

Additionally, sometimes you need to refresh your Coursera page in order for your progress to be registered. If you refresh this page after you complete your lab, the green check mark should appear.

**Best practices for completing labs:**

- Make sure your browser is up to date with the latest version.
    
- Make sure your internet connection is stable.
    
- After you complete the lab, leave the lab window open for at least 10 minutes in order to allow the system to record your progress.
    
- If you run into issues connecting to the lab, try logging into Coursera in an Incognito mode and completing the lab there.
    
- Review [Lab tips and troubleshooting steps](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assets-threats-and-vulnerabilities/supplement/QJJhf/lab-tips-and-troubleshooting-steps "reading on lab tips and troubleshooting steps") for more information.
