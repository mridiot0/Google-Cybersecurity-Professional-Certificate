# Activity: Create hash values

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll create and evaluate the hash values for two files. You will use Linux commands to calculate the hash of two files and observe any differences in the hashes produced. Then, you'll determine if the files are the same, or different. **Disclaimer:** For optimal performance and compatibility, it is recommended to use either **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox** browsers while accessing the labs.

## What you’ll do

You have multiple tasks in this lab:

- List the contents of the home directory
    
- Compare the plain text of the two files presented for hashing
    
- Compute the sha256sum hash of the two separate files
    
- Compare the hashes provided to identify the differences
    

## Lab instructions

### **Start the lab**

Before you start, you can review the [Resources for completing labs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assets-threats-and-vulnerabilities/supplement/HTg94/resources-for-completing-labs). Then from this page, click **Launch App**. A Qwiklabs page will open and from that page, click **Start Lab** to begin the activity!

_You may attempt this lab a maximum of 5 times, and you will have 60 minutes to complete this lab during each attempt._

### **End the lab**

From within the lab, click **End Lab** to end your lab.

Additionally, sometimes you need to refresh your Coursera page in order for your progress to be registered. If you refresh this page after you complete your lab, the green check mark should appear.

**Best practices for completing labs:**

- Make sure your browser is up to date with the latest version.
    
- Make sure your internet connection is stable.
    
- After you complete the lab, leave the lab window open for at least 10 minutes in order to allow the system to record your progress.
    
- If you run into issues connecting to the lab, try logging into Coursera in an Incognito mode and completing the lab there.
    
- Review [Lab tips and troubleshooting steps](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assets-threats-and-vulnerabilities/supplement/QJJhf/lab-tips-and-troubleshooting-steps "reading on lab tips and troubleshooting steps") for more information.
