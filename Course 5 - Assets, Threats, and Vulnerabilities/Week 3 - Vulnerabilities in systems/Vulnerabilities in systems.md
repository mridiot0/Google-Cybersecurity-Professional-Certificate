# Open source intelligence
Cyber attacks can sometimes be prevented with the right information, which starts with knowing where your systems are vulnerable. Previously, you learned that the CVE® list and scanning tools are two useful ways of finding weaknesses. But, there are other ways to identify vulnerabilities and threats.

In this reading, you’ll learn about open-source intelligence, commonly known as OSINT. OSINT is the collection and analysis of information from publicly available sources to generate usable intelligence. It's commonly used to support cybersecurity activities, like identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities. You'll learn why open-source intelligence is gathered and how it can improve cybersecurity. You’ll also learn about commonly used resources and tools for gathering information and intelligence.

## Information vs intelligence
The terms intelligence and information are often used interchangeably, making it easy to mix them up. Both are important aspects of cybersecurity that differ in their focus and objectives.

Information refers to the collection of raw data or facts about a specific subject. Intelligence, on the other hand, refers to the analysis of information to produce knowledge or insights that can be used to support decision-making.

For example, new information might be released about an update to the operating system (OS) that's installed on your organization's workstations. Later, you might find that new cyber threats have been linked to this new update by researching multiple cybersecurity news resources. The analysis of this information can be used as intelligence to guide your organization's decision about installing the OS updates on employee workstations.

In other words, intelligence is derived from information through the process of analysis, interpretation, and integration. Gathering information and intelligence are both important aspects of cybersecurity.

## Intelligence improves decision-making 
Businesses often use information to gain insights into the behavior of their customers. Insights, or intelligence, can then be used to improve their decision making. In security, open-source information is used in a similar way to gain insights into threats and vulnerabilities that can pose risks to an organization.

OSINT plays a significant role in information security (InfoSec), which is the practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.

For example, a company's InfoSec team is responsible for protecting their network from potential threats. They might utilize OSINT to monitor online forums and hacker communities for discussions about emerging vulnerabilities. If they come across a forum post discussing a newly discovered weakness in a popular software that the company uses, the team can quickly assess the risk, prioritize patching efforts, and implement necessary safeguards to prevent an attack.

Here are some of the ways OSINT can be used to generate intelligence:

- To provide insights into cyber attacks

- To detect potential data exposures

- To evaluate existing defenses

- To identify unknown vulnerabilities

Collecting intelligence is sometimes part of the vulnerability management process. Security teams might use OSINT to develop profiles of potential targets and make data driven decisions on improving their defenses.

### OSINT tools
There's an enormous amount of open-source information online. Finding relevant information that can be used to gather intelligence is a challenge. Information can be gathered from a variety of sources, such as search engines, social media, discussion boards, blogs, and more. Several tools also exist that can be used in your intelligence gathering process. Here are just a few examples of tools that you can explore:

[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
 is a service that allows anyone to analyze suspicious files, domains, URLs, and IP addresses for malicious content.

[MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/)
 is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

[OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/)
 is a web-based interface where you can find OSINT tools for almost any kind of source or platform.

[Have I been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
 is a tool that can be used to search for breached email accounts.

There are numerous other OSINT tools that can be used to find specific types of information. Remember, information can be gathered from a variety of sources. Ultimately, it's your responsibility to thoroughly research any available information that's relevant to the problem you’re trying to solve.

## Key takeaways
Gathering information and intelligence are important aspects of cybersecurity. OSINT is used to make evidence-based decisions that can be used to prevent attacks. There’s so much information available, which is why it's important for security professionals to be skilled with searching for information. Having familiarity with popular OSINT tools and resources will make your research easier when gathering information and collecting intelligence.

# The importance of updates
At some point in time, you may have wondered, “Why do my devices constantly need updating?” For consumers, updates provide improvements to performance, stability, and even new features! But from a security standpoint, they serve a specific purpose. Updates allow organizations to address security vulnerabilities that can place their users, devices, and networks at risk.

In a video, you learned that updates fit into every security team’s remediation strategy. They usually take place after a vulnerability assessment, which is the internal review process of an organization's security systems. In this reading, you’ll learn what updates do, how they’re delivered, and why they’re important to cybersecurity.

## Patching gaps in security
An outdated computer is a lot like a house with unlocked doors. Malicious actors use these gaps in security the same way, to gain unauthorized access. Software updates are similar to locking the doors to keep them out.

A patch update is a software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Patches usually contain bug fixes that address common security vulnerabilities and exposures.

Note: Ideally, patches address common vulnerabilities and exposures before malicious hackers find them. However, patches are sometimes developed as a result of a zero-day, which is an exploit that was previously unknown.

### Common update strategies
When software updates become available, clients and users have two installation options:

- Manual updates

- Automatic updates

As you’ll learn, each strategy has both benefits and disadvantages.

### Manual updates
A manual deployment strategy relies on IT departments or users obtaining updates from the developers. Home office or small business environments might require you to find, download, and install updates yourself. In enterprise settings, the process is usually handled with a configuration management tool. These tools offer a range of options to deploy updates, like to all clients on your network or a select group of users.  

**Advantage**: An advantage of manual update deployment strategies is control. That can be useful if software updates are not thoroughly tested by developers, leading to instability issues.

**Disadvantage**: A drawback to manual update deployments is that critical updates can be forgotten or disregarded entirely.

### Automatic updates
An automatic deployment strategy takes the opposite approach. With this option, finding, downloading, and installing updates can be done by the system or application.

**Pro tip**: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommends using automatic options whenever they’re available.

Certain permissions need to be enabled by users or IT groups before updates can be installed, or pushed, when they're available. It is up to the developers to adequately test their patches before release.

**Advantage**: An advantage to automatic updates is that the deployment process is simplified. It also keeps systems and software current with the latest, critical patches.

**Disadvantage**: A drawback to automatic updates is that instability issues can occur if the patches were not thoroughly tested by the vendor. This can result in performance problems and a poor user experience.

### End-of-life software
Sometimes updates are not available for a certain type of software known as end-of-life (EOL) software. All software has a lifecycle. It begins when it’s produced and ends when a newer version is released. At that point, developers must allocate resources to the newer versions, which leads to EOL software. While the older software is still useful, the manufacturer no longer supports it. 

Note: Patches and updates are very different from upgrades. Upgrades refer to completely new versions of hardware or software that can be purchased.

[CISA recommends discontinuing the use of EOL software](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-patches-and-software-updates)
 because it poses an unfixable risk to systems. But, this recommendation is not always followed. Replacing EOL technology can be costly for businesses and individual users.

The risks that EOL software presents continues to grow as more connected devices enter the marketplace. For example, there are billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, like smart light bulbs, connected to home and work networks. In some business settings, all an attacker needs is a single unpatched device to gain access to the network and cause problems.

### Key takeaways
Updating software and patching vulnerabilities is an important practice that everyone should participate in. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. Many of the biggest cyber attacks in the world might have been prevented if systems were kept updated. One example is the WannaCry attack of 2017. The attack affected computers in more than 150 countries and caused an estimated $4 billion dollars in damages. Researchers have since found that WannaCry could have been prevented if the infected systems were up-to-date with a security patch that was made available months before the attack. Keeping software updated requires effort. However, the benefits they provide make them worthwhile.

# Types of threat actors
Anticipating attacks is an important skill you’ll need to be an effective security professional. Developing this skill requires you to have an open and flexible mindset about where attacks can come from. Previously, you learned about attack surfaces, which are all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.

Networks, servers, devices, and staff are examples of attack surfaces that can be exploited. Security teams of all sizes regularly find themselves defending these surfaces due to the expanding digital landscape. The key to defending any of them is to limit access to them.

In this reading, you’ll learn more about threat actors and the types of risks they pose. You’ll also explore the most common features of an attack surface that threat actors can exploit.

## Threat actors
A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. This broad definition refers to people inside and outside an organization. It also includes individuals who intentionally pose a threat, and those that accidentally put assets at risk. That’s a wide range of people!

Threat actors are normally divided into five categories based on their motivations:

- Competitors refers to rival companies who pose a threat because they might benefit from leaked information.

- State actors are government intelligence agencies.

- Criminal syndicates refer to organized groups of people who make money from criminal activity.

- Insider threats can be any individual who has or had authorized access to an organization’s resources. This includes employees who accidentally compromise assets or individuals who purposefully put them at risk for their own benefit.

- Shadow IT refers to individuals who use technologies that lack IT governance. A common example is when an employee uses their personal email to send work-related communications.

In the digital attack surface, these threat actors often gain unauthorized access by hacking into systems. By definition, a hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. Similar to the term threat actor, hacker is also an umbrella term. When used alone, the term fails to capture a threat actor’s intentions.

A group of hackers on a world map carrying assets.

## Types of hackers
Because the formal definition of a hacker is broad, the term can be a bit ambiguous. In security, it applies to three types of individuals based on their intent:

1. Unauthorized hackers 

2. Authorized, or ethical, hackers

3. Semi-authorized hackers

An unauthorized hacker, or unethical hacker, is an individual who uses their programming skills to commit crimes. Unauthorized hackers are also known as malicious hackers. Skill level ranges widely among this category of hacker. For example, there are hackers with limited skills who can’t write their own malicious software, sometimes called script kiddies. Unauthorized hackers like this carry out attacks using pre-written code that they obtain from other, more skilled hackers.

Authorized, or ethical, hackers refer to individuals who use their programming skills to improve an organization's overall security. These include internal members of a security team who are concerned with testing and evaluating systems to secure the attack surface. They also include external security vendors and freelance hackers that some companies incentivize to find and report vulnerabilities, a practice called bug bounty programs.

Semi-authorized hackers typically refer to individuals who might violate ethical standards, but are not considered malicious. For example, a hacktivist is a person who might use their skills to achieve a political goal. One might exploit security vulnerabilities of a public utility company to spread awareness of their existence. The intentions of these types of threat actors is often to expose security risks that should be addressed before a malicious hacker finds them.

## Advanced persistent threats
Many malicious hackers find their way into a system, cause trouble, and then leave. But on some occasions, threat actors stick around. These kinds of events are known as advanced persistent threats, or APTs.

An advanced persistent threat (APT) refers to instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time. The term is mostly associated with nation states and state-sponsored actors. Typically, an APT is concerned with surveilling a target to gather information. They then use the intel to manipulate government, defense, financial, and telecom services.

Just because the term is associated with state actors does not mean that private businesses are safe from APTs. These kinds of threat actors are stealthy because hacking into another government agency or utility is costly and time consuming. APTs will often target private organizations first as a step towards gaining access to larger entities.

## Access points
Each threat actor has a unique motivation for targeting an organization's assets. Keeping them out takes more than knowing their intentions and capabilities. It’s also important to recognize the types of attack vectors they’ll use.

For the most part, threat actors gain access through one of these attack vector categories:

- Direct access, referring to instances when they have physical access to a system

- Removable media, which includes portable hardware, like USB flash drives

- Social media platforms that are used for communication and content sharing

- Email, including both personal and business accounts

- Wireless networks on premises

- Cloud services usually provided by third-party organizations

- Supply chains like third-party vendors that can present a backdoor into systems

Any of these attack vectors can provide access to a system. Recognizing a threat actor’s intentions can help you determine which access points they might target and what ultimate goals they could have. For example, remote workers are more likely to present a threat via email than a direct access threat.

## Key takeaways
Defending an attack surface starts with thinking like a threat actor. As a security professional, it’s important to understand why someone would pose a threat to organizational assets. This includes recognizing that every threat actor isn’t intentionally out to cause harm.

It’s equally important to recognize the ways in which a threat actor might gain access to a system. Matching intentions with attack vectors is an invaluable skill as you continue to develop an attacker mindset.
