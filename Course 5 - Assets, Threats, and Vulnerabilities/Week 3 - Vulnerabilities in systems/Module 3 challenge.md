### Question 1
#### A hotel chain has outdated WiFi routers in their guest rooms. An attacker hacked into the devices and stole sensitive information from several guests. The outdated WiFi router is an example of what?

* An exploit
* A threat
* [x] A vulnerability
* An access control

### Question 2
#### What security strategy uses a layered approach to prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive data?

* Kerchoff’s principle
* Caesar's cipher
* [x] Defense in depth
* Triple DES (3DES)

### Question 3
#### What is the difference between the application and data layers of the defense in depth model?

* The application layer maintains the integrity of information with controls like encryption and hashing. The data layer blocks network traffic from untrusted websites.
* [x] The application layer secures information with controls that are programmed into the application itself. The data layer maintains the integrity of information with controls like encryption and hashing.
* The data layer includes controls like encryption and hashing to secure data at rest. The application layer protects individual devices that are connected to a network.
* The data layer only allows employees to access information. The application layer secures information with controls that are programmed into the application itself.

### Question 4
#### Fill in the blank: According to the CVE® list, a vulnerability with a score of _____ or above is considered to be a critical risk to company assets that should be addressed right away.

* [x] 9
* 1
* 11
* 4

### Question 5
#### Which of the following are characteristics of the vulnerability management process? Select two answers.

* Vulnerability management should be a one-time process.
* [x] Vulnerability management is a way to limit security risks.
* [x] Vulnerability management should consider various perspectives.

### Question 6
#### A security team is conducting a periodic vulnerability assessment on their security procedures. Their objective is to review gaps in their current procedures that could lead to a data breach. After identifying and analyzing current procedures, the team conducts a risk assessment. What is the purpose of performing a risk assessment?

* To fix vulnerabilities that have been identified
* [x] To score vulnerabilities based on their severity and impact
* To adjust current security procedures
* To simulate attacks that could be performed against each vulnerability

### Question 7
#### Fill in the blank: All the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit is called an attack _____.

### Question 9
#### What phase comes after identifying a target when practicing an attacker mindset?

* Prepare defenses against threats.
* [x] Determine how the target can be accessed.
* Evaluate the target's attack vectors.
* Find the tools and methods of attack.

### Question 10
#### What are ways to protect an organization from common attack vectors? Select three answers.

* By not practicing an attacker mindset
* [x] By keeping software and systems updated
* [x] By educating employees about security vulnerabilities
* [x] By implementing effective password policies
