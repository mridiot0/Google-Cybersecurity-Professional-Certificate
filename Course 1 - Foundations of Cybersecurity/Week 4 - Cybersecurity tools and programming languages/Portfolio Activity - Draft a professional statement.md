3. Select two of your values. Examples might include upholding an individualâ€™s right to privacy and a commitment to helping organizations ensure confidential data is safe.

4. Create a core statement that represents your purpose or intention. In this case, your purpose or intention is to briefly explain or summarize your strengths and values in one to two sentences.
