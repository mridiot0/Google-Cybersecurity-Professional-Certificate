### Question 1
#### Which line of code converts the integer 7 to a string?

* `string(7)`
* `str("7")`
* `string("7")`
* [x] `str(7)`

### Question 2
#### Which line of code returns a copy of the string "bmoreno" as "BMORENO"?

* [x] `print("bmoreno".upper())`
* `print(upper("bmoreno"))`
* `print("bmoreno"(upper))`
* `print(upper."bmoreno"())`

### Question 3
#### In the string "network", which character has an index of 1?

* [x] `"e"`
* `"n"`
* `"k"`
* `"t"`

### Question 4
#### You need to take a slice from a network ID. Specifically, you must extract the characters with indices of 6 through 10. Complete the Python code to take this slice and display it. (If you want to undo your changes to the code, you can click the Reset button.)

```py
network_id = "l693m585n528"
print(network_id[6:11])
```

#### What string does the code output?

* [x] `"85n52"`
* `"m585n"`
* `"5n528"`
* `"585n5"`

### Question 5
#### What is the output of the following code?

```py
list1  = [1, 2, 3] 
list2 = ["a", "b", "c"]
print(list1 + list2)
```

#### What is the output of the code?

* `[6, "abc"]`
* `[1, "a", 2, "b", 3, "c"]`
* `An error message`
* [x] `[1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c"]`

### Question 6
#### What is the output of the following code?

```
approved_users = ["bmoreno", "elarson", "tshah", "eraab"]
print(approved_users[1])
```

#### What is the output of the code?

* `["bmoreno", "elarson", "tshah", "eraab", 1]`
* [x] `"elarson"`
* `"bmoreno"`
* `[1, "bmoreno", "elarson", "tshah", "eraab"]`

### Question 7
#### What is an algorithm?

* [x] A set of rules to solve a problem
* A function that returns information
* A function that finds matches to a pattern
* A set of guidelines to keep code consistent

### Question 8
#### What does the \w symbol match to in a regular expression?

* Any character and symbol
* Any number
* [x] Any alphanumeric character
* Any letter

### Question 9
#### What module do you need to import to use regular expressions in Python?

* `os`
* `csv`
* [x] `re`
* `time`

### Question 10
#### Which method adds input to the end of a list?

* `.insert()`
* [x] `.append()`
* `.index()`
* `.lower()`
