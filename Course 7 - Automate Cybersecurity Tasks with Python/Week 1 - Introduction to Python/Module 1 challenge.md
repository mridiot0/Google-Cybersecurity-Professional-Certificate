### Question 2
#### What is wrong with the following code?
```py
for username in failed_login:

print(username)
```

* [x] The line with `print(username)` is not indented.
* Both lines are not indented.
* The first line should be split in two, and in `failed_login:` should be indented on the new line.
* The line with `print(username)` is not indented.

### Question 3
#### What data type requires quotation marks (" ")?

* Float
* Integer
* [x] String
* Boolean

### Question 4
#### Which data type always has a value of either True or False?

* [x] Boolean
* List
* Float
* String

### Question 5
#### What are the variables in the following code? Select all that apply.
```py
username = "kcarter"

attempts = 5

print(username)

print(attempts)

print("locked")
```
  

* "kcarter"

* [x] attempts

* [x] username

* "locked"


### Question 6
#### What code can you use to return the data type of the value stored in the `input` variable?

* `print(input)`
* [x] `type(input)`
* `print("string")`
* `type("string")`

### Question 7

### You are checking whether the string stored in a device_id variable matches to the correct device ID, the string "15hgu3769". When it matches, you want to print, "Login successful!". Which conditional statement has the correct syntax needed to do this?

* `if "device_id" = "15hgu3769"

	`print("Login successful!")`

* [x] `if device_id == "15hgu3769":

	`print("Login successful!")`

* `if "device_id == 15hgu3769"

	`print("Login successful!")`

* `if device_id != "15hgu3769"

	`print("Login successful!")`

### Question 8

### You wrote the following code:

```py 
if attempts >= 5:

	print("locked")

else:

	print("try again")
```

### If the value in the attempts variable is 3, what will Python do?

* Output the message "locked"

* First output the message "try again" and then output the message "locked"

* First output the message "locked" and then output the message "try again"

* [x] Output the message "try again"


### Question 9

### What iterative statement can you use if you want to print "Security alert" five times?

* `for i in range(1,5):

		print("Security alert")`

* [x] `for i in range(5):

		`print("Security alert")`

* `for i in [0, 5]:

		`print("Security alert")`

* `for i in range(6):`

		`print("Security alert")`

### Question 10

You want to print all even numbers between 0 and 10 (in other words, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). What should your next line of code be?

```py
count = 0

while count <= 10:

print(count)
```


* if count < 10:

* [x] count = count + 2

* count = 1

* count = count + 1
