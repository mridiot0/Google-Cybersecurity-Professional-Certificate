* Physical security
* Attack surface

### Question 2
#### What is the term for all the potential system vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit?

* Risk

### Question 3
#### Hiring a security guard is an example of a _____ security hardening practice.

* [x] physical
* network-focused
* virtual
* software-based

### Question 4

* [x] Penetration testing
* Packet sniffing
* The Ping of Death
* A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack

### Question 5
#### Which of the following are OS hardening tasks? Select three answers.

* [x] Using secure encryption standards
* [x] Implementing multifactor authentication
* [x] Regularly installing updates
* Installing security cameras

### Question 6
#### A/An _____ is a documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates.

* [x] baseline configuration
* virtual private network installation
* network segment
* internet control message protocol update

### Question 7
#### Which OS hardening practice requires users to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network?

* [x] Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
* Port filtering
* SIEM
* Patch updates

### Question 8
#### In what way might port filtering be used to protect a network from an attack?

* [x] To disable unused ports in order to reduce the attack surface
* To inspect, analyze, and react to security events based on their priority
* To create isolated subnets for different departments in an organization
* To increase the attack surface in a network

### Question 9
#### A security team considers the best way to handle the different security zones within their network. They prioritize protecting the restricted zone by separating from the rest of the network and ensuring it has much higher encryption standards. What does this scenario describe?

* [x] Network segmentation
* Patch updating

### Question 10
#### How can a security professional confirm that no unverified changes have occurred within a cloud server?

* [x] Compare the server baseline image to the data in cloud servers
* Perform a penetration test
* Establish multifactor authentication (MFA)
* Use port filtering to block or allow certain updates
